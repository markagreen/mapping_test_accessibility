# Scripts

Description of scripts:

* calculate_access.R - estimates accessibility of point (location) data
* geoviz_access_map.R - creates the featured map in the RGS Geovisualisation blog
* locating_new_sites.Rmd - code for estimating the location of new test sites for asymptomatic testing in Liverpool
* location_allocation_model.R - code for running location-allocation modelling for estimating optimal site coverage
possible_LCC_sites.Rmd - location-allocation modelling for estimating where new testing sites should be located

No data is shared currently due to data sharing requirements, so code is to provide examples of how to recreate plots.
